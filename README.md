# Bellman Expectation Equation — Vector Form!

I reformulated the Bellman Expectation Equation using vector dot products instead of the usual summation sigma summation notation.

g = γ⃗ · r⃗ 

o⃗ = r⃗ + γv⃗'

q = p⃗ · o⃗

v = π⃗ · q⃗

## What's novel

The Bellman Expectation Equation is the foundation of reinforcement 
learning, but standard presentations are either hard to read or hard 
to compute with:

- **Scalar/summation form** (Sutton & Barto style): precise but the 
  structure is buried in sigma notation
  
- **Matrix/operator form** (theoretical papers): elegant but abstract

This cheat sheet takes a middle path: 3 explicit vector dot products and 
a vector summation equation that expose the full computational skeleton 
of the equation in a form immediately readable to anyone with basic linear algebra. In 2 FORMS:

- Gibbs Notation (the traditional vector notation)
- Einstein Notation

The four steps are:

1. **g = γ⃗ · r⃗** — discounted return as a dot product
2. **o⃗ = r⃗ + γv⃗'** — outcome vector (one-step Bellman backup)
3. **q = p⃗ · o⃗** — state-action value as expected outcome
4. **v = π⃗ · q⃗** — state value as expected Q-value under policy

## Who this is for

Students and practitioners who want to see the Bellman equation 
as a concrete linear algebra computation rather than an abstract 
expectation over probability distributions.

Professors, who empathsize with students struggling to learn these concepts.

First of all, I want to thank my great reinforcement-learning Professor, Professor Ausif Mahmood, for encouraging us graduate students to fully understand the derivation of the Bellman Equations. That as the motivation for my quest, that culminated in arriving at the above succinct formulation.

Secondly, I would like to give credit to Claude and Gemini. Both were my indispensible partners in this quest. This is clearly the dawn of a new era!
